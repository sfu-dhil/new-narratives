Subjects
========

The New Narratives database assigns subjects to the works it
records. Two subject taxonomies are used: a carefully currated list
of terms selected from PhilPapers_ and the subjects assigned by
librarians and catalogers as recorded in WorldCat_.

PhilPapers
----------

PhilPapers maintains an extensive and well-defined list of subject
terms. In the New Narratives project, only a select few are used.

WorldCat
--------

WorldCat aggregates data from many different libraries.
