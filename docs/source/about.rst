About New Narratives
====================

The New Narratives in the History of Philosophy project aims to develop new 
narratives of our philosophical past that centrally include women thinkers, and 
thereby to reconfigure, enrich, and reinvigorate the philosophical canon. 
Currently, our particular focus is on 17th and 18th century Europe. Women 
writing in the 17th and 18th centuries have been largely ignored and/or 
excluded from the traditional philosophical canon. Our project aims to recover 
and make available works by early modern women. As these works become available 
they shift many of the central narratives and questions in the history of 
philosophy. We are creating research tools including an open access website; 
developing and shaping curricular resources to enrich the teaching of the 
history of philosophy; building an international network of scholars, students, 
and academic institutions supporting research on non-canonical philosophers; 
and increasing awareness among the general public of long neglected aspects of 
our intellectual past. Making these resources digitally available will aid 
scholars, students, and especially teachers interested in integrating works by 
early modern women into their curriculums. We are supported by SSHRC Partnership 
Development Grant.
